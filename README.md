Code examples for programming AWS Lambda with different programming languages:

- Node.js / JavaScript
- Python
- Java
- C#

The code samples were created using the serverless framework (for Node.js, Python), Eclipse (for Java), and Visual Studio 2015 (for C#), respectively.

A video tutorial that I recorded in March 2017 can be purchased via Pack Publishing: <https://www.packtpub.com/virtualization-and-cloud/learning-aws-lambda-video>. In the video, I explain the basic programming and deployment model for AWS Lambda and I show how to combine AWS Lambda with other AWS services, in particular, with API Gateway Service, DynamoDB, and S3, using different programming languages for implementing the business logic. The focus of the video is on JavaScipt/Node.js (Volume I) but I also give a short introduction to programming AWS Lambda (in combination with different AWS services) using Java with Eclipse, Python with serverless framework, and C# with .NET and Visual Studio (Volume II).

You can also view an older video that I recorded in March 2016 and published on YouTube: <https://youtu.be/1lYNuR2LwMw> (the older video is for free, however, slightly outdated, only for programming AWS Lambda with Node.js, and not as professionally recorded as the one that you can buy from [Packt Publishing](https://www.packtpub.com/virtualization-and-cloud/learning-aws-lambda-video).
